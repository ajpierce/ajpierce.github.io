<strong>Andrew J. Pierce</strong> lives in Oakton, VA (USA).

Andrew likes gardening and [Taiji/Qigong](http://qielements.com/), so he's bascially
a grandma. But he's actually a Dad.

Currently employed at [BlackSky](https://blacksky.com), Andrew spends most of his
time in Javascript, even though he'd rather work in Clojure. He's used about a
dozen languages in some kind of professional context.

Andrew has some [old projects](https://github.com/ajpierce) on GitHub that are
in no way indicative of his current abilities, but they have, like, <em>over</em> 10
stars, so he's kind of a big deal. 

Sometimes, Andrew even adds stars to his own projects.

Git and VIM are the two tools that have had the strongest positive impact on Andrew's
professional workflow.  In fact, if you see VA license plate `GIT & VIM` while
you're out driving, shoot him a üëç
