      <description>Update 2017-08-22 Looks like the latest version of Clojurescript (1.9.908) broke something! If you see an error that looks like this:
&amp;hellip;then you&amp;rsquo;ll have to downgrade Clojurescript to version 1.9.854. In the :dependencies block near the top of your project.clj, modify the Clojurescript version to look like:
[org.clojure/clojurescript &amp;quot;1.9.854&amp;quot;]  After that, restart figwheel and you should be good to go!
Thanks to Gene Kim for pointing this out!</description>

      <title>React in Figwheel from Scratch</title>

      <description>Update 2: 2017-08-10 This tutorial is out of date! Check out the updated version!
Update: 2017-07-30 Since publishing the original post, the Clojurescript team implemented CLJS-2280, which handles the work of shimming process.env for us.
As if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, the team also released Clojurescript 1.9.854, meaning that we no longer need to build the latest version of Clojurescript from source!
The other thing that changed is that :npm-deps are no longer installed automatically, and the newly-added :install-deps build property is not yet supported in lein-figwheel, so I&amp;rsquo;m holding off on updating the tutorial until Figwheel catches up for us üëç</description>
